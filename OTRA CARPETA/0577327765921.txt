DATA PROTECTION NOTICE: YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL BE PROCESSED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE CARRIERâ€™S PRIVACY POLICY AND, IF YOUR BOOKING IS MADE VIA A RESERVATION SYSTEM PROVIDER (â€œGDSâ€), WITH ITS PRIVACY POLICY. THESE ARE AVAILABLE AT HTTPS://WWW.IATATRAVELCENTRE.COM/PRIVACY OR FROM THE CARRIER OR GDS DIRECTLY. YOU SHOULD READ THIS DOCUMENTATION, WHICH APPLIES TO YOUR BOOKING AND SPECIFIES, FOR EXAMPLE, HOW YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS COLLECTED, STORED, USED, DISCLOSED AND TRANSFERRED.

ADVICE TO INTERNATIONAL PASSENGERS ON LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY
PASSENGERS EMBARKING UPON A JOURNEY INVOLVING AN ULTIMATE DESTINATION OR A STOP IN A COUNTRY OTHER THAN THE COUNTRY OF DEPARTURE ARE ADVISED THAT THE PROVISIONS OF AN INTERNATIONAL TREATY (THE WARSAW CONVENTION, THE 1999 MONTREAL CONVENTION, OR OTHER TREATY), AS WELL AS A CARRIER'S OWN CONTRACT OF CARRIAGE OR TARIFF PROVISIONS, MAY BE APPLICABLE TO THEIR ENTIRE JOURNEY, INCLUDING ANY PORTION ENTIRELY WITHIN THE COUNTRIES OF DEPARTURE AND DESTINATION. THE APPLICABLE TREATY GOVERNS AND MAY LIMIT THE LIABILITY OF CARRIERS TO PASSENGERS FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY, DESTRUCTION OR LOSS OF, OR DAMAGE TO, BAGGAGE, AND FOR DELAY OF PASSENGERS AND BAGGAGE.
ADDITIONAL PROTECTION CAN USUALLY BE OBTAINED BY PURCHASING INSURANCE FROM A PRIVATE COMPANY. SUCH INSURANCE IS NOT AFFECTED BY ANY LIMITATION OF THE CARRIER'S LIABILITY UNDER AN INTERNATIONAL TREATY. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONSULT YOUR AIRLINE OR INSURANCE COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE.

NOTICE OF BAGGAGE LIABILITY LIMITATIONS
LIABILITY FOR LOSS, DELAY, OR DAMAGE TO BAGGAGE IS LIMITED UNLESS A HIGHER VALUE IS DECLARED IN ADVANCE AND ADDITIONAL CHARGES ARE PAID. FOR MOST INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL (INCLUDING DOMESTIC PORTIONS OF INTERNATIONAL JOURNEYS) THE LIABILITY LIMIT IS APPROXIMATELY $9.07 PER POUND FOR CHECKED BAGGAGE AND $400 PER PASSENGER FOR UNCHECKED BAGGAGE. FOR TRAVEL WHOLLY BETWEEN U.S. POINTS, FEDERAL RULES REQUIRE ANY LIMIT ON AN AIRLINE'S BAGGAGE LIABILITY TO BE AT LEAST $4,700 PER PASSENGER. EXCESS VALUATION MAY BE DECLARED ON CERTAIN TYPES OF ARTICLES. SOME CARRIERS ASSUME NO LIABILITY FOR FRAGILE, VALUABLE OR PERISHABLE ARTICLES. FURTHER INFORMATION MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE CARRIER.
CARRIER RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REFUSE CARRIAGE TO ANY PERSON WHO HAS ACQUIRED A TICKET IN VIOLATION OF APPLICABLE LAW OR CARRIER'S TARIFFS, RULES OR REGULATIONS SUBJECT TO TARIFF REGULATIONS.
